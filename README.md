# My-Playwright-project

This project was created as part of a **UI Automation Testing course** and serves as a demonstration of mastering the studied material.  
The task was to develop a **Test Automation Framework** using **Playwright** with **TypeScript** as the programming language, following industry best practices such as the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.

The main focus is on testing key functionalities of the demo web store:  
Filtering and sorting products on [demo.nopcommerce.com](https://demo.nopcommerce.com)  
ðŸ”¹ Verifying the navigation to the correct product category
ðŸ”¹ Filtering by manufacturer
ðŸ”¹ Filtering by price  
ðŸ”¹ Filtering by memory size (for notebooks)  
ðŸ”¹ Sorting products on page by different options (e.g. by price from Low to High) 
ðŸ”¹ Sorting products by number of items per page  
ðŸ”¹ Verifying correct product info
